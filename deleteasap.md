## Documentation Update Request: Module 3 Implementation - Role-Based Access Control & Admin Impersonation

Dear Documentation Writer,

We have completed the implementation of Module 3, which focuses on role-based access control (RBAC) and admin impersonation features. Please update the existing documentation to reflect these changes. Here's a detailed breakdown of what has been implemented and what documentation needs updating:

### 1. Core Features Implemented

#### Role-Based Access Control
- User roles system (admin and user roles)
- Protected routes with role-based access
- Authentication context with role management
- Route protection based on user roles
- Unauthorized access handling

#### Admin Impersonation Feature
- Admin-only impersonation bar (48px height, fixed position)
- User switching functionality
- Real-time view switching
- Persistent admin privileges during impersonation
- Clear visual indicators for impersonation state

#### Authentication Improvements
- Enhanced error handling in auth flows
- Password reset functionality
- Improved session management
- Supabase client optimization

### 2. Technical Implementation Details

#### Authentication Context
- Updated AuthContext with impersonation support
- Added role-based access control
- Implemented user profile management
- Enhanced error handling and loading states

#### Components Added/Modified
- AdminImpersonationBar component
- Enhanced ProtectedRoute component
- Updated Layout component
- Modified Navigation component
- Improved SignIn/SignUp components

#### Testing Implementation
- Added role-based access control tests
- Implemented admin impersonation tests
- Enhanced authentication flow tests
- Added UI component tests

### 3. Documentation Files to Update

#### 1. `docs/README.md`
- Add section about role-based access control
- Update features list to include admin impersonation
- Update project structure to reflect new components
- Add information about authentication improvements

#### 2. `docs/architecture.md`
Add/Update:
- Authentication flow diagram
- Role-based access control architecture
- Admin impersonation feature design
- Component hierarchy with new additions
- State management for user roles and impersonation

#### 3. `docs/database.md`
Add/Update:
- User profile schema with role field
- RLS policies for role-based access
- Table permissions based on user roles
- Data access patterns for admin impersonation

#### 4. `docs/testing.md`
Add new sections for:
- Role-based access control testing
- Admin impersonation testing
- Authentication flow testing
- Component testing strategy
- Test utilities and mocks

#### 5. `docs/modules/module3.md`
- Mark all implementation steps as completed
- Add actual implementation details
- Update testing scenarios with actual results
- Add any deviations from original plan
- Document additional features implemented

### 4. Key Points to Emphasize

1. Security Considerations
- Role-based access control implementation
- Session management during impersonation
- Authentication state handling
- Error handling and validation

2. User Experience
- Clear visual indicators for admin impersonation
- Smooth transition between user views
- Improved error messaging
- Enhanced navigation based on roles

3. Testing Coverage
- Role-based access control tests
- Admin impersonation functionality
- Authentication flows
- Component integration tests

### 5. Implementation Specifics

#### Authentication Flow
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: UserProfile | null;
  loading: boolean;
  isImpersonating: boolean;
  impersonatedUser: UserProfile | null;
  originalAdminUser: UserProfile | null;
  signIn: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  signUp: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  signOut: () => Promise<void>;
  resetPassword: (email: string) => Promise<void>;
  impersonateUser: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  stopImpersonating: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Role Types
```typescript
type UserRole = 'user' | 'admin';

interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### 6. Additional Notes

1. Testing Updates
- Document new test utilities
- Update testing strategies
- Add information about test coverage
- Include examples of role-based tests

2. Performance Considerations
- Document Supabase client optimization
- Note about state management efficiency
- Explain caching strategies

3. Future Considerations
- Document potential improvements
- Note scalability considerations
- List planned enhancements

### 7. Documentation Style Guidelines

- Maintain existing documentation style
- Use consistent terminology
- Include code examples where relevant
- Update all diagrams and flowcharts
- Ensure cross-referencing between documents

Please ensure all documentation updates maintain consistency with existing documentation style and format. All code examples should be properly formatted and include TypeScript types. Update any diagrams or flowcharts to reflect the new architecture and flows.

Remember to:
1. Preserve existing documentation structure
2. Update only relevant sections
3. Maintain consistent terminology
4. Include practical examples
5. Update all cross-references
6. Verify technical accuracy
7. Update version numbers where applicable

If you need any clarification or additional information about specific implementations, please don't hesitate to ask.
